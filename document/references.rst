If you publish a paper in which SALMON makes an important contribution,
we suggest you to cite the following articles.

-  If you use SALMON for electron dynamics calculations of a large-size
   system, the following paper that discusses massively parallel
   implementation utilizing spatial divisions will be appropriate:

      M. Noda et.al, Massively-parallel electron dynamics calculations
      in real-time and real-space: toward applications to nanostructures
      of more than ten-nanometers in size, J. Compute. Phys., 2014, 265,
      145-155.

-  if you use SALMON to calculate electron dynamics in a unit cell of
   crystalline solid, the following paper discussing formalism and
   numerical implementation will be appropriate:

      G.F. Bertsch et.al, Real-space, real-time method for the
      dielectric function, Phys. Rev. B62, 7998 (2000).

-  The following paper is one of the first implementations of the
   real-time time-dependent density functional calculation, in
   particular, instantaneous kick for the linear response calculations:

      K. Yabana et.al, Phys. Rev. B54, 4484 (1996).

-  If you use multiscale calculation coupling Maxwell equations for the
   electromagnetic fields of light and electron dynamics, the following
   paper discussing the formalism and the numerical implementation will
   be appropriate:

      K. Yabana et.al, Time-dependent density functional theory for
      strong electromagnetic fields in crystalline solids, Phys. Rev.
      B85, 045134 (2012).

-  The following paper describes parallelization method for the coupled
   Maxwell - TDDFT calculations:

      S.A. Sato et.al, Maxwell + TDDFT multi-scale simulation for
      laser-matter interaction, J. Adv. Simulat. Sci. Eng. 1, 98 (2014).

-  The following paper describes computational aspects of electron
   dynamics calculations for periodic systems in many-core processors:

      Y. Hirokawa et.al, Electron dynamics simulation with
      time-dependent density functional theory on large scale symmetric
      mode Xeon Phi Cluster, IEEE IPDPS Workshop PDSEC'16 (2016).
